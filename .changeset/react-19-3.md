React lifted from the 19.1 hold to `^19.3.0`. The `pnpm.overrides` pinning `react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to 19.1 are removed together with the Dependabot ignore for React minors; the workspace resolves to a single React copy without the workspace-root dev dependencies the hold had needed. Peer ranges (`^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`) are unchanged. API reports regenerated: `@types/react` 19.3 spells JSX return types as `React.JSX.Element`, a rendering change only.
