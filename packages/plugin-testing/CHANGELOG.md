### Patch Changes

- 1234904: Make `dist` the canonical published entry point so an `npm`-based publish can't ship broken packages.

  Previously each package's top-level `main`/`types`/`exports` pointed at `./src/*`,
  with the `dist`-pointing map only under `publishConfig`. That is only correct when
  the publish tool applies `publishConfig` (pnpm does; `npm publish`/`npm pack` do
  not) — so a plain `npm publish` (e.g. the first-publish bootstrap) would ship a
  tarball whose entry points resolve to `src/`, which isn't in the published `files`.

  Now the top-level `exports` are `dist`-canonical for consumers, and `publishConfig`
  is reduced to `{ "access": "public" }`. There is deliberately no `development`
  condition pointing at `src`: vite/vitest activate `development` by default, so a
  published map carrying it would send _consumers'_ tooling to a `src/` path that is
  not in the tarball (caught by the SDK publish smoke-test). Inside the monorepo the
  dev server resolves source via the shell's vite aliases, and tests resolve built
  `dist` (turbo orders `^build`/`^build:types` first). No public API changed; this is
  packaging metadata only.

  Note this fixes the _entry points_ only. `workspace:*` dependency specifiers are
  still rewritten to real ranges by `pnpm publish` (which `changeset publish` uses),
  not by plain `npm publish` — so the first-publish bootstrap must use `pnpm`, as
  documented in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

- ed4a3d8: Declare `sideEffects` for tree-shaking, and add API-surface tracking to three more packages.
  - `sideEffects: false` on the pure packages (`utils`, `plugin-system`, `query`,
    `router`, `store`, `ui-config`, `app-runtime`, `plugin-testing`) so bundlers can
    drop unused exports. `@oc-mui/ui` uses `["**/*.css"]` (it ships `globals.css`).
    `@oc-mui/i18n` is intentionally left unset — its entry initialises i18next at
    import time, which is a real side effect.
  - `@oc-mui/app-runtime`, `@oc-mui/utils`, and `@oc-mui/plugin-testing` gain an
    `api-extractor.json` + `api-check`/`api-check:ci` scripts + a committed
    `etc/*.api.md`, so unintended public-API changes are caught in review (matching
    the six packages that already had this).
